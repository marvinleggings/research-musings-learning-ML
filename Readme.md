# Intro

This repository is just a place for me to explore at a fundamental machine learning algorithms how they work and applications. The intention is to write things from scratch as much as possible and to understand what is going in the background.

To explore useful datasets and applications of the algorithms this is just a bit of fun and put some ideas that may be slightly out there and lets see where it goes....

I'm going to keep notes as I go for my own interest. 

Development will be done in Python and C whatever I feel like working with when I have time to explore. 

If you happen to stumble across this and have any comments/criticisms etc. please go wild. 

If you are working anything and would like to bounce ideas with someone go for it
