It seems that the basis of a feed-forward neural network is a single layer perceptron. This at its most basic consists of input values which are then multiplied by weights and these values are passed into what is effectively a summing junction. The outputs can be calculated using simple matrix algebra, and then passed through an activation function. 

For a simple example the activation could be a peice wise defined a threshold.
